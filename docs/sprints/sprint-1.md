### 7. Testing Infrastructure

- ✅ Set up test folder structure
- ✅ Created unit test files for core functionality
- ✅ Implemented widget tests for UI components
- ✅ Added integration test structure
- ✅ Configured mockito for Firebase mocking

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. State Management: Provider
**Reasoning:**
- Simple and effective for this project size
- Great Flutter integration
- Easy to test and maintain
- Sufficient for current requirements

### 2. Architecture: Clean Architecture with MVVM
**Reasoning:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- High testability
- Easy to maintain and scale
- Platform-independent business logic

### 3. Error Handling: Either Pattern (dartz)
**Reasoning:**
- Functional approach to error handling
- Type-safe error propagation
- Clear success/failure paths
- Better than try-catch for business logic

### 4. Security: Environment Variables
**Reasoning:**
- Prevents credential exposure in public repo
- Easy local development setup
- Industry standard approach
- Supports multiple environments

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Public Repository Security
**Problem:** Need to keep Firebase credentials secure in a public repository
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive .gitignore, .env system, and detailed security documentation

### Challenge 2: Clean Architecture Setup
**Problem:** Complex folder structure for a new project
**Solution:** Created clear documentation and followed established patterns from the Flutter community

### Challenge 3: Firebase Integration
